Katie: Hi there! Thank you for agreeing to participate in this user research interview. Can you tell me how you first heard about our dating app?
Mark: I saw an ad for it on Instagram. I was curious and decided to give it a try.
Katie: Great, thank you. What are your overall impressions of the app?
Mark: I'm not really impressed. The matches I'm getting are not relevant to me and it's just a waste of time.
Katie: I'm sorry to hear that. We do our best to provide relevant matches for our users, but sometimes there may be a mismatch. Can you tell me more about what you're looking for in a partner?
Mark: Well, I've specified my preferences and interests in my profile, but I'm still getting matched with people who don't share any of those things with me. It's frustrating and I'm considering deleting the app.
Katie: I see. We'll look into this and see if there's a way to improve the matching algorithm. In the meantime, you can try adjusting your preferences and interests in your profile to see if that helps.
Mark: I've already tried that and it hasn't made a difference. I'm just not happy with the app and the service it's providing.
Katie: I understand. What do you like least about the app?
Mark: I don't like that I have to pay for some of the features. I understand that you need to make money, but I think it's a little expensive.
Katie: We do offer some free features, and we try to keep the paid features reasonably priced. Have you had any difficulty using any of the app's features?
Mark: Yes, I've had some issues with the messaging feature. It keeps crashing and I can't have a conversation with anyone.
Katie: We'll look into that and see if we can fix the issue. Have you met any interesting people through the app?
Mark: No, not really. The matches I've gotten have all been boring and not worth my time.
Katie: I'm sorry to hear that. What other dating apps have you used, if any?
Mark: I've used a few other apps, and they were all better than yours.
Katie: I see. How does our app compare to those other apps?
Mark: The other apps had more diverse and interesting users, and the matching algorithms were better. Your app just feels like it's lacking in comparison.
Katie: Thank you for your feedback. Would you recommend our app to your friends or family? Why or why not?
Mark: No, I wouldn't recommend it. It's not worth the time or money in my opinion.
Katie: We're sorry to hear that. What could we do to improve the app?
Mark: I think the matching algorithms need a lot of work. You should also offer more free features and make the paid features less expensive.
Katie: We'll definitely take that feedback into account. Is there anything else you'd like to share about your experience with our app?
Mark: No, that's all. I'm just disappointed with the app and I'm considering deleting it.`

A: Hey everyone!

B: What’s up Sally?

A: Let’s get started. 

C: Good Tony, how are you?

B: Yeah good.

A: We have a lot to cover today. Freddy, can you give us an update on the product launch?

D: Yeah so ummm, we haven’t made too much progress, mostly because we’re still waiting on our vendors. They said they should have the contract ready by early next week and our sprint doesn’t end until the end of the week, so earliest we can get tagging done is next Friday. 

A: So where does that put the launch?

D: Probably not going to happen until the 28th.

A: Gotcha, and what does that mean for design Sally?

C: Designs should be ready well before then. Just wrapping up some small things now.

A: Ok, so that puts on track for the 28th. How is the reporting coming along Tony?

B: It’s coming along. So far we’ve created a dashboard with all the user metrics and need to finish up with our revenue and monetization metrics. Are you going to want to do ad hoc analysis Freddy?

D: Yeah that’d be great if possible.

B: Ok, we’ll have to make some adjustments for that then. Let’s sync up about what you need offline.

D: Sounds good!

A: Ok great, so we’re on track for a launch on the 28th. If anyone needs anything then just ping me on Slack. Thanks everyone.

A: Bye all.

B: See ya!

C: Later.
